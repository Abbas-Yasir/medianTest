# Problem Statement
We are provided with two sorted arrays named array_1 and array_2 of size n each and we need to find the median of the array obtained after merging the provided two sorted arrays.

The first input is the sequential set of elements of the first array.
The second input is the sequential set of elements of the second array.
## Constraints
array_1.length == m
array_2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-10^6 <= array_1[i], array_2[i] <= 10^6
